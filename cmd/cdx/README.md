# Description 

Facilitates saving commonly used directories

# TODO

> Before implementing the next item, consider cdx interaction with `~/dir-prefixes.sh`. Consider programatically deducing dir name by removing the shell variables prefix, and interpreting the remaning chars in an case-insensitive mannor. Also consider programatically assigning the dir prefix shell variables.
> Move saved dirs to a seperate file, perhapse in json format, or a format natively readable by unix-like shells. This file should then be ignored, and a template file of the same name with `.example` appended be added under source control.
